1/ Board Representation:

The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid (a 2D array) where each cell can be empty (' '), contain 'X', or 'O' representing the players' moves.

2/Initialization:

The game starts by initializing the board to an empty state.

3/ Player Turns:

Players take turns entering their moves.
The current player is either 'X' or 'O'.
Players input the row and column where they want to place their mark.

4/Move Validation:

Before making a move, the game checks if the selected cell is empty. If it is, the move is valid; otherwise, the player is asked to make another move.

5/ Updating the Board:

After a valid move, the board is updated with the current player's mark.
Checking for a Win:

After each move, the game checks if the current player has won.
It checks rows, columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals for three consecutive marks.

6/ Game End Conditions:

If a player wins or if all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends.
If there is a winner, the game declares the winner (current player).
If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a draw.

7/ Displaying the Board:

The game displays the current state of the board after each move.

8/ Switching Players:

After each move, the current player is switched to the other player ('X' becomes 'O' and vice versa).

9/Looping until Game End:

The game continues in a loop until there is a winner or a draw.

10/ Printing the Final Result:

When the game ends, the final state of the board is displayed, and the result is announced (winner or draw).
